#TICTACTOE

##Why?

I wanted to challenge myself to make a CLI version of tictactoe using pointers and structs to challenge myself. This is also going to be used as a demo when teaching a group of incoming FRC programmers as an example of some non-robotics projects we will work on!

##How do I use?

Simply use the provided makefile, and BOOM! you have a executable to play tic tac toe! if you are really fancy (and are on linux) you can move it /usr/local/bin to be able to use it anywhere!!
